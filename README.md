# Azure App Service

## Step 1: Create an empty/default Python app on Azure. 

Azure App Service provides us with a capability of creating a default Python App on Azure App Service. 

There are a bunch of ways in creating this default Python App - we use Portal and CLI in our case.

## Creating a Python Web App using Console

Follow the course instructions to get this started

## Creating a Python Web App using CLI

The easiest way to create the Python Web App is to issue the command: `az webapp up` from your code folder. Based on the code stack you have in the folder (repo), Azure will deduce the runtime stack (if your code is a Python code repo, it will set the runtime stack as Python and so on), assigns the defaults for rest of them. 

Let's fetch the sample Python code I have in the [Azure Handson Python](https://github.com/madhusudhankonda/azure-handson-python) repo, as discussed in the next step.

### Checkout Python Git Repo

Checkout the azure-handson-python codebase. 

`
git clone https://github.com/madhusudhankonda/azure-handson-python.git
`
Change to the code directory:

`
cd azure-handson-python
`
Now your sample code is ready, let's create an empty appservice for Python runstack. 

### Create Python App

Azure will let us know the sensible defaults that it would apply when we run `az webapp up --dryrun` - the dryrun flag wouldn't create the resources but for our information purposes only. Let's go with this route for now:

Once moved to azure-handson-python folder, issue the following command without the `dryrun`:

`az webapp up`

This command would create all the required configuration for our Python App. It would take a minute or two to get this resource created. You should see an output something like this:

```
âžœ  azure-handson-python git:(main) az webapp up
The webapp '.....' doesn't exist
Creating Resource group '....' ...
Resource group creation complete
...
--name/-n default: vxxxxx-xxxxxx
{
  "URL": "http://xxxxx-xxxxxx.azurewebsites.net",
  "appserviceplan": "xxxxxxxxx_asp_1869",
  "location": "eastus",
  "name": "xxxxx-xxxxxx",
  "os": "Linux",
  "resourcegroup": "xxxxxxxxx_asp_1869",
  "runtime_version": "python|3.10",
  "runtime_version_detected": "-",
  "sku": "PREMIUMV2",
  "src_path": "//Users//mkonda//DEV//OLT//AZURE_HANDSON//azure-handson-python"
}
```

As you can see, the Python App was created for us with sensible defaults (note that Azure chose Premium size plan). We can instead provide our own details. The following command is an updated command with custom details:

```
az webapp up --name olt-webapps-test-123 --sku B1 --location eastus --resource-group rg-olt-apps-123
```
Executing this command would create the required resoruces and most importantly the Python app will be deployed and ready to be accessed.

## Access the Python App

Now that we've managed to create the App, let's check it out.

On your WebApp (in Portal, you should find a "Default domain" (on the right hand side) for our application, as you can see in this image:
